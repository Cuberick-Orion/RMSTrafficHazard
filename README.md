The script to pull Live Traffic Data from RMS live source and record in csv files.

Please run record_all.py

Incident, Roadwork, MajorEvent data will be stored separately

Live Traffic Data is obtained in the form of JSON file from RMS API
[CHANGED] Files in this folder are updated automatically (and renamed so that each time the new files will overwrite the old ones), every time the program receives a new file, it processes it and copies it here to sync with DropBox

[NOTE!] The program cannot overwrite the old csv file with a new one if the old file is opened by Excel, and that will cause an error. If you plan to access the file (from Dropbox local synced folder) please first copy and paste it to somewhere else and open it. Thanks!
